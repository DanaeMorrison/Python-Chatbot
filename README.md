# Chatbot

This program allows a user to interact with it as though having a conversation. It is deterministic- if a user enters the same input per use of the program, the program will give the same output.
The user's input is largely constrained to specific responses that the program will force the user to respond with in order to continue the conversation. 
In this way, it does not resemble the nuanced nature of a real conversation, but it allows a user to have short conversations on a few topics as well as play a game against the program.
This was made for one of my first assignments in my first Computer Science course at Mount Allison University.

If I were to attempt this assignment again, I would provide more potential responses from the program to input from the user and include a randomization element
that allows the program to respond differently to the same input from the user during a given conversation.
